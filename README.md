# threshold

> Create a front end dev boilerplate with [grunt-init][], including a Grunt workflow.

[grunt-init]: http://gruntjs.com/project-scaffolding

## Installation
If you haven't already done so, install [grunt-init][].

Once grunt-init is installed, place this template in your `~/.grunt-init/` directory. It's recommended that you use git to clone this template into that directory, as follows:

```
git clone git@github.com:reintroducing/threshold.git ~/.grunt-init/threshold
```

_(Windows users, see [the documentation][grunt-init] for the correct destination directory path)_

## Usage

At the command-line, cd into an empty directory and run this command:

```
grunt-init threshold
```

Next, install all the packages that Grunt needs to function correctly:

```
npm install
```

_You may need to use sudo depending on your setup._

You should now have a great starting point to begin coding without having to mess with setting up a build script or directory structure/files.

_Note that this template will generate files in the current directory, so be sure to change to a new directory first if you don't want to overwrite existing files._
